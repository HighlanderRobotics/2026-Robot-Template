# 8033 2026 Template

This repo provides a starting point for 8033's 2026 code. The goal is to clean up and port our 2025 swerve, vision, and auto code to the WPILib 2026 beta. This is not our 2026 Rebuilt repo - I'm unsure if WPILib will support in place upgrading from betas to the kickoff release but in any case copypasting it should be trivial.
